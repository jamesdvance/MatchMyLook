# MatchMyLook

A homegrown project to practice visual similarity search and embeddings. 

## Process
1. Prototype with just pre-trained feature embedding
2. Train segmentation model on full body images to get 
3. Scrape dataset to include full-body images
4. experiment with Siamese networks, encoder/decoder models
5. Combine into an app
